        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">1. Notification of Claimed Infringement</h3>
        <p>
          If you believe that your copyrighted work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and
          is accessible on our website, you may notify our copyright agent as set forth in the DMCA. For your complaint
          to be valid under the DMCA, you must provide the following information in writing:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>An electronic or physical signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner;</li>
          <li>Identification of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;</li>
          <li>
            Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing and where it is located on the website;
          </li>
          <li>
            Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as your address, telephone number, and

          </li>
          <li>
            A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not
            authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or law; and
          </li>
          <li>
            A statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information is accurate, and that you are the

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">2. Counter-Notification</h3>
        <p>
          If you believe that your content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that
          you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to
          post and use the material in your content, you may send a counter-notification containing the following
          information to our copyright agent:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
          <li>
            Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at
            which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
          </li>
          <li>
            A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of
            mistake or a misidentification of the content; and
          </li>
          <li>
            Your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of
            the federal court in [Your Jurisdiction], and a statement that you will accept service of process from the
            person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If a counter-notification is received by our copyright agent, we may send a copy of the counter-notification
          to the original complaining party informing that person that we may replace the removed content or cease
          disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the
          content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14
          business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.
